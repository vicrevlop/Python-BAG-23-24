I often live too far in the future. Wondering about how I will feel tomorrow or in 10 years. I need to focus on the now. I love this quote from Master Oogway (Kung Fu Panda) “Yesterday is history Tomorrow is a mystery And today is a gift That’s why we call it the present”
I’m working out to my tennis pre match playlist… aiiiii I get so pumped. Too much nostalgia
Thank you for holding the door open for me…. But if I’m a football field away please go ahead and go in… I don’t wanna rush- by the time I get there I’m sweating like crazy and stressed 🙈. Anyone feel me?
Today is hair day! I’m braids. I get so excited for hair day- Sure it takes hours but it’s worth it. I’ve been waiting all week. I’m in the best mood today. I’m walking telling everyone yassss queen! Can anyone else relate?
Dall-e got tired of me asking for images.
Butterfingers are so under rated. 🍫
Starting to collect match-worn jerseys. thanks to @ACMomento I’d say I’m off to a good start with these four stars from the USWNT. Who should I go after next?!
Back to work we go ….
This makes me so happy
I am not ok today. And that’s ok to not be ok. No one is ok every single day. If you are not ok today I’m with you. There’s always tomorrow 😘Love you.
Orange slices (you know the candy) are my kryptonite.
You ever get so tired your brain stops working and you can’t think of basic things?
Having 2 kids is def not easy. How do you moms/ dads do it so well!!!??? Especially when one gets sick? Mad respect
Have you ever wanted to start your work out but suddenly remembered your to do list…. That you have not done in years…. Lol. That’s me this morning 🙈🙈
It’s unhealthy on how excited I am for the new *NSYNC music for the Trolls movie. I physically can’t wait. I am overly excited. Anyone else?
I’m not used to working out with no goal or to be honest - no championship in my mind. This is super weird.
8 is a better number.

Some people cry not because they are weak… but because they have been strong for too long.
