Smart money always makes the same moves.
A thread of tweets that show why they really put me in jail.  Spoiler alert: I’ve never raped anybody.
Death penalty for all knife crime offences in the UK. Enough is enough.
I would never, ever, ever, get down on one knee for any woman - ever. If I allow her the chance to marry me she will accept as I stand upright like a MAN. I bow to God. Absolutely nothing or nobody else.
Lazy people do a little work and feel like they should be winning. Winners work as hard as possible and still worry they’re being lazy.
They're going to force a carbon credit system on all of us. The secret is, you'll be able to buy Carbon Credits, pay a fine or maybe donate to certain charities. SOMETHING. They will force you to eat no meat while they party on their Yachts. In the future I will be known as…
Pain in my head. Pain in my heart. Pain in my torso. Pain for mi dawgs. 
I turned down 50m to sell my soul. All I had to do was shut up on certain subjects and sell trash to kids. I refused. Then I was arrested. Elon turned down 500m plus.  Not many hero’s left. G.
Being broke, unconnected and weak should bother you deep inside. And only once it deeply bothers you, you will truly attempt to fix it.
Real Gs know that Nsync made bangers. Bye bye byeeeeee
Life is actually very simple. Become as strong and as rich as possible. Help your family, friends and community become as strong and rich as possible. Raise your children to become as strong and rich as possible. Win and help those around you win. 
Your life gets better only when you get better
2024 will be chaotic. It will be hard. But it will also be full of opportunity. You are running out of time to prepare.
Any man who hates driving is a bitch. Afraid of the “stress” of traffic or “risk” of crashing. Gay.

I cant explain how much I do NOT want sex with these hoes.
The difference between a conspiracy theory and reality is usually around 6 weeks.
I refuse to wear the same suit twice for the entirety of this Matrix attack. 2 years and counting.
First file is toast. Slowly being torn apart. More freedom etc. They’re working on a second and pressuring “victims” as we speak.
Missing a day's training won't ruin you. But the mentality that believes it's okay to miss a day will.
Once people are no longer impressed or afraid of your violence. Even once youve doubled down. You return to the negotiating table in the weakest possible position. The crude brute whos temper tantrum failed and now wants to talk. Embarrassing.
Men used to conquer foreign lands. Now we make money, train, build our bloodline, and more. Men MUST conquer something.
You cannot try to change the world and expect to live a peaceful life. Heroes always get attacked by the villains.
You’re not a mysogonist to want a kind loving and loyal woman who adores you.
You’ve been taught to be a lone wolf. When true power is MAN power. Two or more men training together. Making money together. Conquering together.
There are hundreds of high-profile cases of men suffering from false accusations. There are thousands of untold stories of normal men having their lives destroyed. I am launching a charity to protect men from this predatory evil.
If you make money there is no peace in life. Your life is only war. But at least it’s your war. Because if you don’t make money you are nothing more than collateral damage in somebody else’s battle.
It’s called clown world because there will always be a large part of the population who believe in the circus.
Liberals are losers. Conservatives are losers. Bro - everyone cucked for Covid besides me. Everyone.
You’re not quirky. You’re just ugly and annoying and dumb.

I’m so proud of everyone for collectively not choosing the Mega Millions lottery numbers 8, 24, 30, 45, 61 and 12. They are ridiculous numbers and we all know it. The best part is that we didn’t even have to ask each other - we just did it… together. And there is strength in…
