The Labor Party are copy-pasting a Morrison-era censorship policy. I have not heard Peter Dutton come out and say, 'Hey, we're really sorry for drafting the legislation Albanese is using to shut you up. We're sorry we leaned on social media to silence you. And we're sorry we erased the victims of mRNA vaccines.' @tntradiolive @SpectatorOz
It's not a coincidence that the people who want to live in smart cities think freedom is dumb.
From the Daily Mail. Everything we watch is so fake. Lisa was re-engineering an interview to make her look more caring. How pathetic. How false.
50 years of energy saving devices marketed under the message: USE AS LITTLE ENERGY AS POSSIBLE OR YOU'RE A BAD PERSON. And now we're straight into: ELECTRIC CARS. ELECTRIC CHARGERS. ELECTRIC PUBLIC TRANSPORT. ALL THE ELECTRIC THINGS. No. We didn't build reliable baseload power to handle it.
The #Left can't get their grievance stories straight. Colonisation is evil. But the areas of Australia with the least colonisation are the most 'oppressed'. To fix the evils of colonisation in the areas with no colonisation, we need to spend taxpayer money to bring coloniser technology to these areas to de-colonise them. That is the line they're trying to run.
20 years ago, companies were not allowed to ask about the race, gender, or sexual preference of their employees. Now, international organisations rate, rank, and give awards to companies based upon the gender, race, and sexual orientation of their staff. Not the quality of their work. Not the success of their business. No. We reward companies on the superficial qualities of their employees as if CEOs were collecting Pokemon rather than people. The height of social justice 'equity' is discrimination. That's the evil of DEI. Human beings are reduced to their appearance rather than their merit.
Social Justice politics is not meant to make sense. That's the whole point. It's meant to cause irreconcilable differences between citizens, collapse the political structure, and prevent society from unifying against the Marxist revolution.
The Left want all the 'white colonisers' to 'go back where they came from' but when they went to Africa - the origin of all humans - they were told to leave. It's so easy to dismantle Marxist race politics ??
It is sensible to be 'phobic' about a dangerous ideology.
"People are getting 'bored' of #ClimateChange, says Peter Ridd Are we living through a 'climate apocalypse' or is this just another beautiful summer in Australia? ""We'd walk across the melting tarmac on the road [as kids], that's how tough we were.""

Local councils: Ban Australia Day. Politicians: Call anyone who wants to celebrate Australia Day 'racist'. Media: Hounds businesses that support Australia Day. Woolworths & Kmart: Refuse to sell Australia Day stuff in case it offends the feelings of people who hate Australia.
I'm not 'anti-vaxx'. I am anti 'being forced to participate in a high-stakes, unpaid drug trial with side effects that include #death'.
Farmers can stage protests in Europe against the #Globalists because they are able to converge on city centres and bring civilisation to a stop. But in Australia... Our farmers are separated by tyrannical distance. Farmers in WA, NT, Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, SA, and NSW cannot converge on Canberra with their farm equipment. The conquest of Australia's farming industry will be silent, performed via the scratch of a thousand pens signing away our land to rich foreign businesses. Governments love this. They can negotiate agricultural policy with Beijing instead of Australians who will punish them at the polls.
So many people wrongly believe that #renewable energy means 'no big holes in the ground' (ie mines). Don't they wonder where all the raw materials come from? Maybe a 'hole in the ground'? ??
Victimhood is the preferred career path for those who have achieved nothing.
Our political leaders are motivated by holding power and making money. They will pursue these goals to the ruin of the country, believing they can flee to another first-world nation. Except, all first world nations are destroying themselves, so there will be nowhere to run.
What is this modern obsession with printing food instead of growing it? ??
Citizen spending did not cause inflation. GOVERNMENT SPENDING caused inflation. Why do banks keep blaming innocent taxpayers for incompetent governments? It couldn't be a conflict of interest with their political mates, surely? ??
"Activism doesn't mean anything anymore. The activist class are pests. A plague of professional agitators who intimidate, bully, disrupt, and destroy. ""Nuisance"" is the only qualification being handed out by Western universities."
One week into 2024 and still feeling like
The reason we'll never get a proper Royal Commission into #Covid is simple... ...the investigation would not only condemn politicians, big pharma, and health authorities - it would also condemn the vast majority of citizens who abused their employees, family, and friends. Who is going to vote for the political party that proves, beyond all doubt, that the majority turned on each other for no reason at all...?
@LeilaniDowding @Ofcom It's a total miracle we survived! Why isn't anyone trying to study us ??
Australia is fighting to stop wind farms destroying native land and butchering endangered species. There is NOTHING #green about giant spinning blades scattered over the landscape.
"""Evidence is mounting regarding the true origin of excess deaths..."" Professor Augusto Zimmermann discusses the safety of mRNA vaccines. ""...they prove behind reasonable doubt that there is a correlation between [Covid] vaccine rollout and an increase in the death rate in 17 different countries, including Australia.""

Pauline Hanson's greatest crime was ... to accurately predict the future. She was right. About everything. And now the establishment are trying to pretend Australia's current mess is 'a total mystery!' @PaulineHansonOz warned us, and they threw her in jail for her trouble.
Indigenous group Navajo Nation tried to stop a recent 'space funeral', calling for the mission to be scrapped because it would 'desecrate' the Moon which is sacred to 'indigenous cultures'. To be clear, the Navajo Nation is not indigenous to the Moon https://spectator.com.au/2024/01/no-one-is-indigenous-to-the-moon/
Australia too.
Looks like fun. But also, definitely need to be packed in bubble-wrap first.
Angela Merkel and her vanity migration project.
It is not a conspiracy to say that celebrities, CEOs, and politicians were frightened of Trump getting into the White House. Say what you want about Trump's style of governance, but he presents a risk to the survival of an elite criminal class.
